This chapter discusses various ways to juggle basic data types in Haskell. A
data type is something like a number or a character of the English alphabet.
When you have a sequence of characters, you get a data type called a string
because you are stringing together a bunch of characters in a given order. You
will learn about another data type called boolean, whose only values are either
true or false. Numbers, strings, and booleans are among the most fundamental
building blocks upon which you construct programs.
