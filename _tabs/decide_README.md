Computers are excellent decision makers. Give them a program, some input data,
and they churn out some other data. Garbage in, garbage out. In this chapter,
you will learn various Haskell constructs to help your program make decisions
depending on the situation at hand. The section
[I can't decide](../decide_conditional/) discusses how to write a program that
branches into several paths. Knowing how to write branches in your program would
help you to write functions of various complexity, the topic of the section
[Simple functions](../decide_function/). The rest of the chapter is devoted to
various techniques to help you write functions that use pattern matching.
