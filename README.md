Haskell might seem like a complicated beast at first. It does not have to be
that way. Let's tackle some basic ideas of the language, bit by bit.

<!--=========================================================================-->

## Development

### Pre-requisites

Install the following on your local machine:

-   (GNU) Make
-   Node
-   Ruby

### Setup

Fork the repository and clone the fork to your local machine. Issue the
following commands to setup everything required by the project:

```sh
$ bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
$ bundle install
$ npm update
```

You need to have Ruby and Node installed in order for the above commands to run
successfully.

### Contribute

Add your changes and issue the command

```sh
$ make build
```

to ensure the whole book compiles successfully. Fix any compilation, spelling,
or other errors, then create a pull request.
